/// Todo's
- Add hotkeys
- Close bot button
- Automate food eating
- Print functions: on level up, on die
- Sometimes the always on top does not work
- Add an option to move the waypoint up and down on the list
- Add an option to insert a new waypoint from the selection (to help creating new waypoints in the middle of a script)
- Add an option to clear all waypoints
- Add an option to load a cavebot script when you first open the bot, so you don't need to load it on every execution
- Add a condition to validate the Pos X, Y, Destin X and Y. If these positions are equal for more than 5 seconds and you are not fighting, move somewhere.
- When you have 1 purple monster and 1 normal monster on the same screen, the bot does not attack the second, he keeps trying to fight the first monster and walk to the next waypoint.
- Some pokemons have the ability to heal themselves, it would be nice to identify the hotkey for this spell and add a "Life Less then X" to use it. (Like Staryu).
- Sometimes when the waypoint is near a wall (north) looks like the left click does not work fine. I suggest that the left click to walk must be placed at the center of the SQM.
- Show the experience acquired and experience per hour
- Show revives used
